# Educational-Text-Translation-A-Cognitive-Informativity-Based-Approach

First, let us try to understand Cognitive Informativity. Let’s break this down into two different things - Cognitive and Informativity. 

Cognitive is defined as:
cog·​ni·​tive ˈkäg-nə-tiv 
: of, relating to, being, or involving conscious intellectual activity (such as thinking, reasoning, or remembering)
E.g. cognitive impairment

: based on or capable of being reduced to empirical factual knowledge

Informativity is concerned with the extent to which the contents of a text are already known or expected as compared to unknown or unexpected.
